## Registration

* During registration, user was not expecting to provide a password. User did not want to create another account and have to create yet another password. 
* During testing, the SMS message was never sent due to a service restart. 

## My Accout
* Verified tag was added by development team and not veted through UX team. More work is needed in this area. Off the top of my head, I could imagine a checkbox icon appearing in the field or in front of it using an input group. A tooltip or popup could be used to explain what the verification status means. The popup tooltip could also contain a button to resend verification.
* User signed up with both email and phone but was only able to verify email address. Users should be able to resend verification links should they have not received them previously.
* Similarly, warning text explains that the account has to be verified before you can receive alerts. but offers no way to resend alerts. 
* Because user had previosly added a phone number there was no way to verify it as the developers indicated that verification was only being sent if the filed was new or had changed. This needs to be addressed.
* User expected to verify their password

## General
* User felt disconnected when site moved from public site (colorful) to the my account page (plain). Perhaps reusing the blue or reusing the graphic in the header would create some connection.
* I also noticed that the logo is missing in the header for my account page.
