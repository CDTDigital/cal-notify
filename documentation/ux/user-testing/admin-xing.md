## Map

* User did not correlate icon and color with the list. 
	- We should add a legend to distinguish categories and severity

## Create Alert

* Source dropdown was not well understood. 
	- I think more information could be provided e.g. "Active Fire Boundaries (USGS GeoMAC)"
	- Is it necessary to reference the right source? e.g. there are multiple NOAA and GIS sources. 
* Drawing tools were not easily understood
	- User was not able to successfully create a map because the app required multiple inputs on the map both in the form of a pin location and a boundary of affected location.
