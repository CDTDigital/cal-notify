# Pushkal - Admin

## General

* List view vs map view was not clear to user. 
	- Perhaps disabling the current state link would help
	- Perhaps color or border to show state
	- Perhaps a button group with an active state 

## Filters

* Select dropdowns should not be empty by default
* Table has no corresponding "Source" column to filters
* Would be nice if date fields contained a date picker

## Map

* User was confused at first as to what the map was for. They did not immediately connect the list to the map. They eventually recognized the connection after they zoomed in.
	- Zoom level should probably default to a limited display of California
* User expected filters from list screen to also appear on map view. This makes sense and should be added

## Alert Creation

* Again user pointed out that dropdown selects were empty. They might benefit from being populated with a a default value or placeholders like "Choose Severity" for example.
* User struggled with draw tools a little. He finally figured it out but it was not super obvious to them
	- While training would help, the user eventually figured out how the tools worked. 
	- User suggested that pin be separated from the polygon tools. This is something we should look at changing. 

## Republish

* Screens were not developed for testing but user was not clear as to what was happening. We might have another look at this area once developed.
