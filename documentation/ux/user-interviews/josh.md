# Citizen Interview Script

## Introduction

Hello [name] thank you for taking the time to meet with me. We are a contractor working with the State of California to help create an emergency notification system. Weâ€™re hoping to get some feedback from you in hopes that we can improve our understanding of how Californians would benefit from an emergency alert system. If we are successful, your feedback today can help improve how Californians are notified of emergency situations.
